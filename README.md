## ðŸ’¡Project IArma 

This project aims to achieve automatic detection of firearms in images using Artificial Intelligence. Individuals carrying firearms in public places are strong indicators of a dangerous situation. Studies have shown that a quick response from authorities is the primary factor in reducing the number of victims. One way to ensure the authorities can act swiftly is through early detection of potentially dangerous situations, with an emphasis on the use of security cameras, closed-circuit television (CCTV), and real-time video. However, the large number of cameras to be monitored leads to overload for CCTV operators, resulting in fatigue and stress, consequently reducing surveillance efficiency. Deep learning neural networks have proven to be efficient in detecting and identifying objects in images, often producing more precise and consistent results than human counterparts.
